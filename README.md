👋 Hi, I'm @linnykerxd9

👀 I am interested in being a programmer

🌱 I'm currently learning a little bit of everything, I love this world of programming and I study more Angular, Java and C #.

💞️ I want to collaborate with the future, I want to positively impact the future and people's lives, for example,
many years ago television was created and only the rich could have it because it was very expensive,
but today anyone has it and it has become an important thing in people's lives and brought them joy,
I want to be able to collaborate with things for the future.
